# FM Bugger Circuit

## Problem Statement
Designing a transmitter which can transmit frequency modulated audio signal which can be detected by an ordinary FM Radio.

## Ideation and Pipeline
* Capturing sound and removing noise -> Frequency Modulation -> Transmission

| Part of the Pipeline | Feasibility | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|----------------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Capturing sound and<br>removing noise | Using mic and<br>few capacitors | Components can be easily<br>found | Low quality of mic can<br>cause problems |
| Amplifying and<br>frequency modulating signal | Using transistors<br>and tank circuit | Works for even low voltage<br>like 3V | Choosing values makes the<br>task little difficult |
| Transmitting signal | Using Antenna | Variety of options available |
