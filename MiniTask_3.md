# FM Bugger Circuit
Try checking in the sequence <br>
*Capturing sound and removing noise -> Frequency Modulation -> Transmission* <br>
Because problem in any one of this can cause in breakdown of circuit

### Checking Capturing Sound and removing noise
Try checking all your connection in circuit whether all parts are connected properly or not. 
If connected and can't here, then it might be problem of microphone.
Try checking mic using circuit given below

If Microphone is working then it might be any other problem which will be noticed in later steps

If you find noise isn't properly removed, then problem might be in these capacitors.
Check whether connections are made proper and if possible test with other possible capacitor values.



~Check whether all parts are connected properly or not.~

Try using different values of capacitor in Tank circuit

check whether oscillator circuit is working or not

Be patient while finding correct frequency in the FM Radio (used as receiver) 

Be careful while making inductor
