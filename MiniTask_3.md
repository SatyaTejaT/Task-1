# FM Bugger Circuit
Try checking in the sequence <br>
*Capturing sound and removing noise -> Frequency Modulation -> Transmission* <br>
Because problem in any one of this can cause in breakdown of circuit

### Checking Capturing Sound and removing noise
Try checking all your connection in circuit whether all parts are connected properly or not. 
If connected and can't here, then it might be problem of microphone.<br>
Try checking mic using circuit given below

If Microphone is working then it might be any other problem which will be noticed in later steps

If you find noise isn't properly removed, then problem might be in these capacitors.
Check whether connections are made proper and if possible test with other possible capacitor values.

### Checking Frequency Modulation 
As you have checked the microphone but still can't hear, then there may be problem in Frequency Modulation<br>
Try checking whether oscillator circuit/Tank ciruit working or not<br>
Try checking inductor as it should be made carefully

### Checking Transmission
Still not hearing dont worry. <br>
Check your antenna whether it is connected prpoerly or not.<br>
Try changing value of capacitor in tank circuit so that frequency may change and fall in required range (88-108).<br>
Be patient while finding correct frequency in the FM Radio (used as receiver) 
If possible try <br>

and find approximate value of frequency
